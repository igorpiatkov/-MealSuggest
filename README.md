## What's MealSuggest

I’ve created MealSuggest to help people who struggle to decide what to cook 👨‍🍳 today, tomorrow, or next week!

You can simply choose your favorite cuisine 🍜 from the list, select a specific diet, exclude ingredients and the app will generate a week meal plan for you 📆. MealSuggest will get you a list of Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner meals with recipes for every single day for a week. Print the plan or email 📩 it to yourself with 1 click and you are ready to cook!
